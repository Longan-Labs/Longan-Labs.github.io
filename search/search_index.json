Pins The edge connector (gold fingers) has total of 30 contacts (each side has 15 contacts). On the front side of the Carduino, a white arrow is printed near the edge connector indicates the pin #1. You can find some pin numbers printed on the edge connector itself (1, 15, and 29). You can count the pin numbers starting with 1 and count by twos from right to left would be 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, and 29. Notice that all the counts are odd numbers. On the back side of the Carduino, you also can find some pin numbers printed on the edge connector itself (2, 16, and 30). You can count the pin numbers starting with 2 and count by twos from left to right would be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30. Notice that all the counts are even numbers. Table below presents the pin numbers and their functions. The pin functions of Carduino is exactly same with the pin functions of Arduino Leonardo. Power connections There are two main ways to power the Carduino. Through the micro-C USB port with 5V Through one of the boards with AAA battery card with 5V Following pins allow you to power the Carduino with batteries (AAA battery card) through one of the Longan boards. VCC \u2013 5V regulated supply voltage (Front: pin #1, #29 / Back: pin #2, #30) GND \u2013 This is the common ground for all power and logic (Front: pin #3, #27 / Back: pin #4, #28) You can also hack the power pins to power the Carduino with a regulated 3.3V or 5V power source. GPIO pins This is the general purpose I/O pin set for the Carduino. GPIO consists of digital, analog, I2C, SPI, and UART pins. Most pins can do PWM output. Also, all pins can be used as interrupt pins. Digital (Front: pin #9, #11, #21 / Back: pin #10, #12, #22) Analog (Front: pin #13, #19 / Back: pin #14, #20) I2C pins You can use I2C pins allow Carduino to communicate with all the Longan cards (all cards are I2C enabled and comes with a factory default unique I2C address). SDA \u2013 The I2C data pin (Front: pin #5, #25 / Back: pin #6, #26) SCL \u2013 The I2C clock pin (Front: pin #7, #23 / Back: pin #8, #24) Hardware SPI pins These are the hardware SPI pins that can be used to communicate with high speed. SCK \u2013 Serial Clock (Front: pin #17) MISO - Master In Slave Out, takes data from the Carduino to the SPI device (Front: pin #15) MOSI \u2013 Master Out Slave In, takes data to the Carduino from the SPI device (Back: pin #16) Hardware UART / Serial These pins can be used to connect devices support with UART using two wires. TX \u2013 Transmits data (Front: pin #21) RX \u2013 Receives data (Back: pin #22) Arduino IDE Setup First download the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software . Arduino IDE can be installed and run on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X operating systems. Download the installer or zip file (Windows only) and install (if you have the zip file, extract it to your Windows computer\u2019s hard drive) it on your operating system. Once finished, start the Arduino IDE. Copy and paste the link below into the Additional Boards Manager URLs option in the Arduino IDE preferences ( File Preferences ). https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/Longan-Board/master/package_longan_boards_index.json The Longan AVR boards supplied package includes supports for Longan Card, Carduino 328, Carduino 32U4. Once done, click OK button to save the new preference settings. Now open the Boards Manager by navigating to the Tools - Board menu. Select All from the Type drop-down menu. Then type longan in the top search bar. While typing, you will see the Longan AVR package. Click on the Longan AVR by Longan Labs and then click on Install button. Once installed, close the Boards Manager window. How to Use Carduino can be plugged in to one of the edge connector slots available in the following boards. Game board Car board Sensor display board Extension board Pi Hap All Longan cards are polarized, and every pin is unique in terms of both location and function. On the front side of the Carduino, a white arrow is printed near the edge connector indicates the pin #1. Using with Extension Board We will be using Longan Extension board demonstrate how you can insert the Carduino in to an edge connector slot. Take the Carduino and Extension board. Then plug the Carduino into the edge connector slot of the Extension board as shown in the picture below. Next, take the AAA battery card and insert two 1.5V or 1.2V, AAA sized batteries. Then insert it in to another edge connector slot on the Extension board. Make sure to slide the power switch of the battery card to the ON position. Now your Carduino can use the battery power to function correctly. Blink We will start off with something very simple with an LED, turning on and off, repeatedly, producing a pleasant blinking effect. The Carduino has a built-in LED on digital pin 13 (Arduino Leonardo equivalent) emits bright blue light when turned on. You can find it on the front of the Carduino (labelled as D13) very close to the Type-C USB connector. Now you can upload your first Blink sketch to the Carduino. The Arduino IDE provides a great example for blinking a LED. There is no need to type anything, just click File Example 01.Basics Blink under Built-in Examples in the Arduino IDE. Connect the Type-C USB cable to the USB connector of the Carduino and connect the other end to your computer. Next, tell the Arduino IDE to use the Carduino. To do this, click Tools Board Carduino 32U4 under Longen AVR Boards. Then select the proper port in Tools Port (the Serial/COM port of your Carduino) . Next, upload the program by clicking Sketch Upload . It will take some time to compile and upload the sketch in to the Carduino. If you have trouble loading the Blink sketch from the examples, you can copy and paste the code below into the Arduino editor. /* Blink Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly. Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to the correct LED pin independent of which board is used. If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino model, check the Technical Specs of your board at: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products modified 8 May 2014 by Scott Fitzgerald modified 2 Sep 2016 by Arturo Guadalupi modified 8 Sep 2016 by Colby Newman This example code is in the public domain. http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink */ // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board void setup() { // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output. pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); } // the loop function runs repeatedly forever void loop() { digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(1000); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(1000); // wait for a second } After uploading the sketch to the Carduino, you should see the LED on the Carduino blinking. When you press the reset button during running your sketch, the Carduino will take some time to re-start the program and blinks the LED very slowly with a fading effect. Now, you can firmly remove the Type-C USB cable from the Carduino to allow to use the battery power with the Longan AAA battery card. When you remove the USB power, the Carduino will automatically switch to the battery power and continually executes the program without resetting the microcontroller. If you want to turn off the Carduino, simply slide the switch to the off position on the AAA battery card.

OBD-II is an improvement over OBD-I in both capability and standardization. The OBD-II standard specifies the type of diagnostic connector and its pinout. 2.Reset Button: Reset the on-board Atmega chip 3.78L05: Provide a stable 5V to the whole system. 4.Atmega32U4: The master of the entire module, mainly used to store data on the TF card or transfer data to the computer through the type C cable. In addition, since it's arduino compatible, you can use it to implement some simple controls, such as triggering a buzzer alarm when the speed exceeds a certain value. 5.MCP2515: Microchip Technology\u2019s MCP2515 is a stand-alone Controller Area Network (CAN) controller that implements the CAN specification, version 2.0B. It is capable of transmitting and receiving both standard and extended data and remote frames. The MCP2515 has two acceptance masks and six acceptance filters that are used to filter out unwanted messages, thereby reducing the host MCUs overhead. The MCP2515 interfaces with microcontrollers (MCUs) via an industry standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). 6.MCP2551 High-Speed CAN Transceiver\uff1aThe MCP2551 is a high-speed CAN, fault-tolerant device that serves as the interface between a CAN protocol controller and the physical bus. Typically, each node in a CAN system must have a device to convert the digital signals generated by a CAN controller to signals suitable for transmission over the bus cabling (differential output). It also provides a buffer between the CAN controller and the high-voltage spikes that can be generated on the CAN bus by outside sources (EMI, ESD, electrical transients, etc.). 7.2x8Pin Female Header for GPS module See the GPS section for specific pin definitions.

However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where some small adjustments are necessary to preserve the desired style. Adding assets MkDocs provides several ways to interfere with themes. In order to make a few tweaks to an existing theme, you can just add your stylesheets and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional stylesheets If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate stylesheet. The easiest way is by creating a new stylesheet file in your docs directory: mkdir docs/stylesheets touch docs/stylesheets/extra.css Then, add the following line to your mkdocs.yml : extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Spin up the development server with mkdocs serve and start typing your changes in your additional stylesheet file \u2013 you can see them instantly after saving, as the MkDocs development server implements live reloading. Additional JavaScript The same is true for additional JavaScript. If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in your docs directory: mkdir docs/javascripts touch docs/javascripts/extra.js Then, add the following line to your mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js Further assistance can be found in the MkDocs documentation . Extending the theme If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some part), you can extend the theme. From version 0.16 on MkDocs implements theme extension , an easy way to override parts of a theme without forking and changing the main theme. Setup and theme structure Reference the Material theme as usual in your mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides, e.g. theme , which you reference using theme_dir : theme : material theme_dir : theme Theme extension prerequisites As the theme_dir variable is used for the theme extension process, the Material theme needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the theme parameter in your mkdocs.yml . The structure in the theme directory must mirror the directory structure of the original theme, as any file in the theme directory will replace the file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further assets may also be put in the theme directory. The directory layout of the Material theme is as follows: . \u251c\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 images/ # Images and icons \u2502 \u251c\u2500 javascripts/ # JavaScript \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ # Stylesheets \u251c\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 disqus.html # Disqus integration \u2502 \u251c\u2500 footer.html # Footer bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 header.html # Header bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language.html # Localized labels \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav-item.html # Main navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav.html # Main navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 search.html # Search box \u2502 \u251c\u2500 social.html # Social links \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source.html # Repository information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs-item.html # Tabs navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs.html # Tabs navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 toc-item.html # Table of contents item \u2502 \u2514\u2500 toc.html # Table of contents \u251c\u2500 404 .html # 404 error page \u251c\u2500 base.html # Base template \u2514\u2500 main.html # Default page Overriding partials In order to override the footer, we can replace the footer.html partial with our own partial. To do this, create the file partials/footer.html in the theme directory. MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding template blocks Besides overriding partials, one can also override so called template blocks, which are defined inside the Material theme and wrap specific features. To override a template block, create a main.html inside the theme directory and define the block, e.g.: {% extends base.html %} {% block htmltitle %} title Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet /title {% endblock %} The Material theme provides the following template blocks: Block name Wrapped contents analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration content Wraps the main content disqus Wraps the disqus integration extrahead Empty block to define additional meta tags fonts Wraps the webfont definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar htmltitle Wraps the title tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries, e.g. Modernizr repo Wraps the repository link in the header bar scripts Wraps the JavaScript application logic source Wraps the linked source files search_box Wraps the search form in the header bar site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_name Wraps the site name in the header bar site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents social Wraps the social links in the footer styles Wraps the stylesheets (also extra sources) For more on this topic refer to the MkDocs documentation Theme development The Material theme is built on modern technologies like ES6, Webpack , Babel and SASS . If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the Material theme and recompile it. This is fairly easy. Environment setup In order to start development on the Material theme, a Node.js version of at least 5 is required, as well as the package manager yarn which is a better version of npm . First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkdocs-material pip install -r requirements.txt yarn install Development mode The Material theme uses a sophisticated asset pipeline using Gulp and Webpack which can be started with the following command: yarn start This will also start the MkDocs development server which will monitor changes on assets, templates and documentation. Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this documentation in front of you. For example, changing the color palette is as simple as changing the $md-color-primary and $md-color-accent variables in src/assets/stylesheets/_config.scss : $ md-color-primary : $ clr-red-400 ; $ md-color-accent : $ clr-teal-a700 ; Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overriden when the theme is built. Build process When you've finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: yarn run build This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all stylesheets and JavaScript sources. When the command exits, the final theme is located in the material directory. Add the theme_dir variable pointing to the aforementioned directory in your original mkdocs.yml . Now you can run mkdocs build and you should see your documentation with your changes to the original Material theme.","title":"Customization"},{"location":"customization/#customization","text":"","title":"Customization"},{"location":"customization/#a-great-starting-point","text":"Project documentation is as diverse as the projects themselves and the Material theme is a good starting point for making it look great.

Installing MkDocs Before installing MkDocs , you need to make sure you have Python and pip \u2013 the Python package manager \u2013 up and running. You can verify if you're already good to go with the following commands: python --version # Python 2.7.13 pip --version # pip 9.0.1 Installing and verifying MkDocs is as simple as: pip install mkdocs mkdocs --version # mkdocs, version 0.16.0 MkDocs version requirements Material requires MkDocs = 0.16. Installing Material using pip Material can be installed with pip : pip install mkdocs-material using choco If you're on Windows you can use Chocolatey to install Material : choco install mkdocs-material This will install all required dependencies like Python and MkDocs . cloning from GitHub Material can also be used without a system-wide installation by cloning the repository into a subfolder of your project's root directory: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git This is especially useful if you want to extend the theme and override some parts of the theme. The theme will reside in the folder mkdocs-material/material . Troubleshooting Installation on macOS When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, pip tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions. There are two possible solutions for this: Installing in user space (recommended): Provide the --user flag to the install command and pip will install the package in a user-site location. This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you may be having with pip . Error: unrecognized theme 'material' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and the Material theme through pip , so both packages end up in different locations. MkDocs only checks it's install location for themes. Usage In order to enable the theme just add one of the following lines to your project's mkdocs.yml . If you installed Material using pip: theme : material If you cloned Material from GitHub: theme_dir : mkdocs-material/material MkDocs includes a development server, so you can review your changes as you go. The development server can be started with the following command: mkdocs serve Now you can point your browser to http://localhost:8000 and the Material theme should be visible. From here on, you can start writing your documentation, or read on and customize the theme through some options. Options The Material theme adds some extra variables for configuration via your project's mkdocs.yml . See the following sections for all available options. Changing the color palette A default is hue is defined for every primary and accent color on Google's Material Design color palette , which makes it very easy to change the overall look of the theme. Just set the primary and accent colors using the following variables: extra : palette : primary : indigo accent : light blue Color names are case-insensitive, but must match the names of the Material Design color palette. Valid values are: red , pink , purple , deep purple , indigo , blue , light blue , cyan , teal , green , light green , lime , yellow , amber , orange , deep orange , brown , grey and blue grey . The last three colors can only be used as a primary color. If the color is set via this configuration, an additional CSS file that defines the color palette is automatically included. If you want to keep things lean, clone the repository and recompile the theme with your custom colors set. See the guide on customization for more information. Primary colors Click on a tile to change the primary color of the theme: Red Pink Purple Deep Purple Indigo Blue Light Blue Cyan Teal Green Light Green Lime Yellow Amber Orange Deep Orange Brown Grey Blue Grey var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-primary]\"); Array.prototype.forEach.call(buttons, function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.dataset.mdColorPrimary = this.dataset.mdColorPrimary; }) }) Accent colors Click on a tile to change the accent color of the theme: Red Pink Purple Deep Purple Indigo Blue Light Blue Cyan Teal Green Light Green Lime Yellow Amber Orange Deep Orange var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-accent]\"); Array.prototype.forEach.call(buttons, function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.dataset.mdColorAccent = this.dataset.mdColorAccent; }) }) Changing the font family By default the Roboto font family is included with the theme, specifically the regular sans-serif type for text and the monospaced type for code. Both fonts are loaded from Google Fonts and can be changed to other fonts, like for example the Ubuntu font family : extra : font : text : Ubuntu code : Ubuntu Mono The text font will be loaded in weights 400 and 700 , the monospaced font in regular weight. If you want to load fonts from other destinations or don't want to use the Google Fonts loading magic, just set font to false : extra : font : false Adding a source repository To include a link to the repository of your project within your documentation, set the following variables via your project's mkdocs.yml : repo_name : my-github-handle/my-project repo_url : https://github.com/my-github-handle/my-project The name of the repository will be rendered next to the search bar on big screens and as part of the main navigation drawer on smaller screen sizes. Furthermore, if repo_url points to a GitHub, BitBucket or GitLab repository, the respective service logo will be shown next to the name of the repository. Additionally, for GitHub, the number of stars and forks is shown. Why is there an edit button at the top of every article? If the repo_url is set to a GitHub or BitBucket repository, and the repo_name is set to GitHub or BitBucket (implied by default), an edit button will appear at the top of every article. This is the automatic behavior that MkDocs implements. See the MkDocs documentation on more guidance regarding the edit_uri attribute, which defines whether the edit button is shown or not. Adding a favicon A favicon can be added by setting the site_favicon variable to an .ico or image file: site_favicon : images/favicon.ico Adding a logo Your logo should have rectangular shape with a minimum resolution of 128x128, leave some room towards the edges and be composed of high contrast areas on a transparent ground, as it will be placed on the colored header bar and drawer. Simply create the folder docs/images , add your logo and embed it with: extra : logo : images/logo.svg Adding social links Social accounts can be linked in the footer of the documentation using the automatically included FontAwesome webfont. The type must denote the name of the social service, e.g. github , twitter or linkedin and the link must contain the URL you want to link to: extra : social : - type : github link : https://github.com/squidfunk - type : twitter link : https://twitter.com/squidfunk - type : linkedin link : https://de.linkedin.com/in/martin-donath-20a95039 The links are generated in order and the type of the links must match the name of the FontAwesome glyph. The fa is automatically added, so github will result in fa fa-github . Google Analytics integration MkDocs makes it easy to integrate site tracking with Google Analytics. Besides basic tracking, clicks on all outgoing links can be tracked as well as how site search is used. Tracking can be activated in your project's mkdocs.yml : google_analytics : - UA-XXXXXXXX-X - auto Disqus integation Material for MkDocs is integrated with Disqus , so if you want to add a comments section to your documentation set the shortname of your Disqus project in your mkdocs.yml : extra : disqus : your-disqus-shortname A new entry at the bottom of the table of contents is generated that is linking to the comments section. The necessary JavaScript is automatically included. Requirements site_url value must be set in mkdocs.yml for the Discus integration to load properly. Localization Translations Material for MkDocs supports internationalization (i18n). In order to translate the labels (e.g. Previous and Next in the footer), you can override the file partials/language.html and provide your own translations inside the macro t : {% macro t ( key ) %}{{ { language : en , edit.link.title : Edit this page , footer.previous : Previous , footer.next : Next , meta.comments : Comments , meta.source : Source , search.languages : , search.placeholder : Search , search.result.placeholder : Type to start searching , search.result.none : No matching documents , search.result.one : 1 matching document , search.result.other : # matching documents , source.link.title : Go to repository , toc.title : Table of contents }[ key ] }}{% endmacro %} Just copy the file from the original theme and make your adjustments. See the section on overriding partials and the general guide on theme extension in the customization guide. Furthermore, see the example configuration for a head start. Site search Site search is implemented using lunr.js , which includes stemmers for the English language by default, while stemmers for other languages are included with lunr-languages , both of which are integrated with this theme. Support for other languages and even multilingual search can be activated by setting the key search.languages to a comma-separated list of supported 2-letter language codes, e.g.: {% macro t ( key ) %}{{ { ... search.languages : en, de, ru , ... }[ key ] }}{% endmacro %} This will automatically load the stemmers for the specified languages and set them up with site search, nothing else to be done. At the time of writing, the following languages are supported: English en , French fr , Spanish es , Italian it , Japanese jp , Dutch du , Danish da , Portguese pt , Finnish fi , Romanian ro , Hungarian hu , Russian ru , Norwegian no , Swedish sv and Turkish tr . Only specify the languages you really need Be aware that including suppport for other languages increases the general JavaScript payload by around 20kb (without gzip) and by another 15-30kb per language. Tabs From version 1.1.0 on, Material supports another layer on top of the main navigation for larger screens in the form of tabs. This is especially useful for larger documentation projects with only few top-level sections.

This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you may be having with pip . Error: unrecognized theme 'material' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and the Material theme through pip , so both packages end up in different locations.

Installation Add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - admonition Usage Admonition blocks follow a simple syntax: every block is started with !!! , followed by a single keyword which is used as the type qualifier of the block. The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces. Example: !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title By default, the block title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can easily be changed by adding a quoted string after the type qualifier. Example: !!! note Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Removing the title Similar to setting a custom title , the icon and title can be omitted by providing an empty string after the type qualifier: Example: !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Embedded code blocks Blocks can contain all kinds of text content, including headlines, lists, paragraphs and other blocks \u2013 except code blocks, because the parser from the standard Markdown library does not account for those. However, the PyMdown Extensions package adds an extension called SuperFences , which makes it possible to nest code blocks within other blocks. Example: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. SELECT Employees . EmployeeID , Employees . Name , Employees . Salary , Manager . Name AS Manager FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Employees AS Manager ON Employees . ManagerID = Manager . EmployeeID WHERE Employees . EmployeeID = 087652 ; Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Types Admonition supports user-defined type qualifiers which may influence the style of the inserted block. Following is a list of type qualifiers supported by the Material theme, whereas the default type, and thus fallback for unknown type qualifiers, is note . Note Example: !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla.

The highlighting process is executed during compilation of the Markdown file. Syntax highlighting not working? Please ensure that Pygments is installed. See the next section for further directions on how to set up Pygments or use the official Docker image with all dependencies pre-installed. Installation CodeHilite parses code blocks and wraps them in pre tags. If Pygments is installed, which is a generic syntax highlighter with support for over 300 languages , CodeHilite will also highlight the code block. Pygments can be installed with the following command: pip install pygments To enable CodeHilite, add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - codehilite Migrating from Material 0.2.x In 0.2.x the CodeHilite extension was included with codehilite(css_class=code) which switched the CSS class from .codehilite to .code . The current version of the theme doesn't require that and defines styles for the default .codehilite class, so the part css_class=code needs to be removed. Usage Specifying the language The CodeHilite extension uses the same syntax as regular Markdown code blocks, but needs to know the language of the code block. This can be done in three different ways. via Markdown syntax recommended In Markdown, code blocks can be opened and closed by writing three backticks on separate lines. To add code highlighting to those blocks, the easiest way is to specify the language directly after the opening block. Example: ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` Result: import tensorflow as tf via Shebang Alternatively, if the first line of a code block contains a shebang, the language is derived from the path referenced in the shebang. This will only work for code blocks that are indented using four spaces, not for those encapsulated in three backticks. Example: #!/usr/bin/python import tensorflow as tf Result: #!/usr/bin/python import tensorflow as tf via three colons If the first line starts with three colons followed by a language identifier, the first line is stripped. This will only work for code blocks that are indented using four spaces, not for those encapsulated in three backticks. Example: :::python import tensorflow as tf Result: import tensorflow as tf Adding line numbers Line numbers can be added by enabling the linenums flag in your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - codehilite(linenums=true) Example: ``` python Bubble sort def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result: 1 2 3 4 5 6 Bubble sort def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting specific lines Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language identifier. Line counts start at 1. Example: ``` python hl_lines= 3 4 Bubble sort def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result: 1 2 3 4 5 6 Bubble sort def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Supported languages excerpt CodeHilite uses Pygments , a generic syntax highlighter with support for over 300 languages , so the following list of examples is just an excerpt.

For this reason, the installation of this package is highly recommended as it's well-integrated with the Material theme. Installation The PyMdown Extensions package can be installed with the following command: pip install pymdown-extensions The following list of extensions that are part of the PyMdown Extensions package are recommended to be used together with the Material theme: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.arithmatex - pymdownx.betterem(smart_enable=all) - pymdownx.caret - pymdownx.critic - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_generator : !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg - pymdownx.inlinehilite - pymdownx.magiclink - pymdownx.mark - pymdownx.smartsymbols - pymdownx.superfences - pymdownx.tasklist(custom_checkbox=true) - pymdownx.tilde Usage GitHub Flavored Markdown Most of the extensions included in the PyMdown Extensions package try to bring the Markdown experience closer to GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). The PyMdown Extensions package adds a shorthand to enable all of the included extensions that provide the GFM experience. However, usage of the shorthand is discouraged, because some extensions are not supported, as the Material theme uses some incompatible extensions included in the standard Markdown library. BetterEm BetterEm improves the handling of emphasis markup ( bold and italic ) within Markdown by providing a more sophisticated parser for better detecting start and end tokens. Read the documentation for usage notes . Emoji Emoji adds the ability to insert a -load of emojis that we use in our daily lives. See the EmojiOne demo for a list of all available emojis.

MagicLink MagicLink detects links in Markdown and auto-generates the necessary markup, so no special syntax is required. It auto-links http[s]:// and ftp:// links, as well as references to email addresses: SuperFences SuperFences provides the ability to nest code blocks under blockquotes, lists and other block elements, which the Fenced Code Blocks extension from the standard Markdown library doesn't parse correctly. Tasklist Tasklist adds support for styled checkbox lists. This is useful for keeping track of tasks and showing what has been done and has yet to be done. Checkbox lists are like regular lists, but prefixed with [ ] for empty or [x] for filled checkboxes. Example: * [x] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit * [x] Nulla lobortis egestas semper * [x] Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est * [ ] Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt * [x] In hac habitasse platea dictumst * [x] In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus * [x] Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis * [ ] Praesent sed risus massa * [ ] Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque * [ ] Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit Nulla lobortis egestas semper Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt In hac habitasse platea dictumst In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis Praesent sed risus massa Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Tilde Tilde provides an easy way to strike through cross out text. The portion of text that should be erased must be enclosed in two tildes ~~...~~ and the extension will take care of the rest. More syntactic sugar Caret Caret is the sister extension of Tilde and makes it possible to highlight inserted text . The portion of text that should be marked as added must be enclosed in two carets ^^...^^ . Mark Mark adds the ability to highlight text like it was marked with a yellow text marker . The portion of text that should be highlighted must be enclosed in two equal signs ==...== . SmartSymbols SmartSymbols converts markup for special characters into their corresponding symbols, e.g. arrows ( , , ), trademark and copyright symbols ( , , ) and fractions ( , , ...). Critic Critic implements Critic Markup , a Markdown extension that enables the tracking of changes (additions, deletions and comments) on documents. During compilation of the Markdown document, changes can be rendered (default), accepted or rejected. Text can be deleted and replacement text added . This can also be combined into one a single operation. Highlighting is also possible and comments can be added inline . Formatting can also be applied to blocks, by putting the opening and closing tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content. Arithmatex MathJax Arithmatex integrates Material with MathJax which parses block-style and inline equations written in TeX markup and outputs them in mathematical notation. See this thread for a short introduction and quick reference on how to write equations in TeX syntax. Besides activating the extension in the mkdocs.yml , the MathJax JavaScript runtime needs to be included. This must be done with additional JavaScript : extra_javascript : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML If you want to override the default MathJax configuration, you can do this by adding another JavaScript file before the MathJax runtime in extra_javascript which contains your MathJax configuration, e.g.: window . MathJax = { tex2jax : { inlineMath : [ [ \\\\( , \\\\) ] ], displayMath : [ [ \\\\[ , \\\\] ] ] }, TeX : { TagSide : right , TagIndent : .8em , MultLineWidth : 85% , equationNumbers : { autoNumber : AMS , }, unicode : { fonts : STIXGeneral, Arial Unicode MS } }, displayAlign : left , showProcessingMessages : false , messageStyle : none }; In your mkdocs.yml , include it with: extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML Blocks Blocks are enclosed in $$ ... $$ which are placed on separate lines. Example: $$ \\frac {n ! }{k !( n - k )! } = \\binom {n}{k} $$ Result: \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} Inline Inline equations need to be enclosed in $ ... $ : Example: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: $ p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } $ Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} InlineHilite InlineHilite adds support for inline code highlighting. It's useful for short snippets included within body copy, e.g. var test = 0 ; and can be achived by prefixing inline code with a shebang and language identifier, e.g. #!js .","title":"PyMdown Extensions"},{"location":"extensions/pymdown/#pymdown-extensions","text":"PyMdown Extensions is a collection of Markdown extensions that add some great features to the standard Markdown library.
