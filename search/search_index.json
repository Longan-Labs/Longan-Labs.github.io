It supports two wire I2C bus interface. The front of the temperature card has following components. LM75A digital temperature sensor Gold fingers (edge connector) Connectors Module card LED indicator Specifications \u00b6 Voltage: 5V Resolution: 0.125 degrees Temperature Range: -55\u00b0 C to 125\u00b0 C Supports two wire I2C bus interface Error of \u00b1 3 \u00b0 C I2C Address \u00b6 The Temperature card at the factory default I2C address of 0x01. The factory default I2C address is printed on the back of the card. Pins \u00b6 The edge connector (gold fingers) has total of 30 contacts (each side has 15 contacts). On the front side of the temperature card, a white arrow is printed near the edge connector indicates the pin #1. You can find some pin numbers printed on the edge connector itself (1, 15, and 29). You can count the pin numbers starting with 1 and count by twos from right to left would be 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, and 29. Notice that all the counts are odd numbers. On the back side of the temperature card, you also can find some pin numbers printed on the edge connector itself (2, 16, and 30). You can count the pin numbers starting with 2 and count by twos from left to right would be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30. Notice that all the counts are even numbers. I2C \u00b6 Following pins can be used for I2C communication. SDA: Digital I/O, I2C bus serial bidirectional data line (Front: pin #5, #25 / Back: pin #6, #26) SCL : Digital Input, I2C bus serial clock input (Front: pin #7, #23 / Back: pin #8, #24) Power \u00b6 Following pins connect with the common power bus of the board. VCC : Power supply (Front: pin #1, #29 / Back: pin #2, #30) GND : To be connected to the system ground (Front: pin #3, #27 / Back: pin #4, #28) I2C Bus and UART Test Point \u00b6 You can solder a break away header (straight, 0.1\u201d pin spacing) to the I2C bus test point. The I2C bus requires two wires to communicate with the device, a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). There is an additional RX, TX, VCC, and GND that is not part of the I2C interface. How to Use \u00b6 The temperature card can be plugged into an edge connector slot of one of the following Longan boards. Game board Car board Sensor board Extension board Pi Hap When you plugging, the white arrow head printed on the card should be pointing toward the white arrow head printed near the edge connector slot of the board. Once plugged, it can communicate with the Carduino through the I2C bus line of the board. It will also connect to the common power bus of the board. Getting Ready \u00b6 You can use the extension board to connect any Longan card with the Carduino. First take the Extension board. Next, plug the temperature card in to one of the edge connector slot. Then plug the Carduino in to another edge connector slot. Finally, connect the extension board with your computer using a Type-C USB cable (you can use either USB connector on the Carduino or the Extension board). Reading Temperature \u00b6 The sample code can be loaded to your Arduino IDE by clicking on File > Examples > LonganCards > ReadSensor . If you have trouble loading the ReadSensor sketch from the examples, you can copy and paste the code below into the Arduino editor. #include <Wire.h> #include \"CardsDfs.h\" #include \"LonganCards.h\" CARD_INFO card; int addr = 0; int cntSensor = 0; float sensorValue[10]; float str2num(unsigned char *str) { float num = 0; memcpy((unsigned char *)(&num), str, 4); return num; } void setup() { // put your setup code here, to run once: Serial.begin(115200); Wire.begin(); while(!Serial.available()); addr = card.scan(); if(0 == addr) { Serial.println(\"NO DEVICE!\"); while(1); } card.getInfo(); card.disp(); cntSensor = card.senCnt; } void loop() { for(int i=0; i<cntSensor; i++) { sensorValue[i] = getValue(i); Serial.print(sensorValue[i], 2); Serial.print('\\t'); } Serial.println(); delay(100); } float getValue(int s) { unsigned char dta[10]; unsigned long len = 0; Wire.beginTransmission(addr); Wire.write(REG_VALUE_START+s); // ADDR_DATA_START = 0x30 Wire.endTransmission(); delay(1); Wire.requestFrom(addr, 6); delay(1); while(Wire.available()) { dta[len++] = Wire.read(); } return str2num(&dta[1]); } // END FILE Connect the Type-C USB cable to the USB connector of the Carduino and connect the other end to your computer. Next, tell the Arduino IDE to use the Carduino. To do this, click Tools > Board > Carduino 32U4 under Longen AVR Boards. Then select the proper port in Tools > Port > (the Serial/COM port of your Carduino) . Next, upload the program by clicking Sketch > Upload . It will take some time to compile and upload the sketch into the Carduino. Once uploaded, open the Serial Monitor by clicking Tools > Serial Monitor . In the Serial Monitor, select 115200 baud from the drop-down list. Then type any number or character (E.g. 1) and click Send button. First, it will output the device information of your temperature card such as I2C address, device id, number of sensors, name length, name, SKU, and version. Then it will continually output the temperature. The blue LED on the ATmega 168P module will blink quickly and continually during the temperature reading from Carduino using I2C communication protocol.","title":"Temperature Card"},{"location":"1011001/#introduction","text":"The temperature card features LM75A which is a temperature-to-digital converter using an on-chip band gap temperature sensor and Sigma-delta A-to-D conversion technique.

When you press the reset button during running your sketch, the Carduino will take some time to re-start the program and blinks the LED very slowly with a fading effect. Now, you can firmly remove the Type-C USB cable from the Carduino to allow to use the battery power with the Longan AAA battery card. When you remove the USB power, the Carduino will automatically switch to the battery power and continually executes the program without resetting the microcontroller. If you want to turn off the Carduino, simply slide the switch to the off position on the AAA battery card.

The Arduino IDE provides a great example for blinking a LED. There is no need to type anything, just click File > Example > 01.Basics > Blink under Built-in Examples in the Arduino IDE. Connect the Type-C USB cable to the USB connector of the Carduino and connect the other end to your computer. Next, tell the Arduino IDE to use the Carduino. To do this, click Tools > Board > Carduino 32U4 under Longen AVR Boards. Then select the proper port in Tools > Port > (the Serial/COM port of your Carduino) . Next, upload the program by clicking Sketch > Upload . It will take some time to compile and upload the sketch in to the Carduino. If you have trouble loading the Blink sketch from the examples, you can copy and paste the code below into the Arduino editor. /* Blink Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly. Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6.

When you press the reset button during running your sketch, the Carduino will take some time to re-start the program and blinks the LED very slowly with a fading effect. Now, you can firmly remove the Type-C USB cable from the Carduino to allow to use the battery power with the Longan AAA battery card. When you remove the USB power, the Carduino will automatically switch to the battery power and continually executes the program without resetting the microcontroller.

Assembly \u00b6 This section will guide you to through assembling the Open Game Station Player Kit into a complete Arduboy game controller. Take the acrylic spacer plate. If you want, peel the protective paper masking off both sides of the acrylic spacer plate. Alternatively, you can leave the masking on for additional thickness. Attach the four brass standoffs onto the acrylic spacer plate. The standoffs should be screwed into the holes from the bottom of the plate. Place the game board on top of the brass standoffs. The standoffs should be screwd into the holes from the top of the game board. Take the AAA battery card, insert two AAA batteries, and plug it in to a vertically mounted edge connector slot as shown in the following figure. The white arrow head printed on the card should be pointing toward the white arrow head printed near the edge connector. Make sure you have the battery card switched to the OFF position. Take the Buzzer card and plug it into a vertically mounted edge connector slot. Take the Carduino 32U4 card and plug it into a vertically mounted edge connector slot. Slide the switch on the Carduino to the D7 / 8 (game board) position. Take the OLED display card. Remove the protective film by gently pull up on the tab. Plug the OLED display card into the horizontally mounted edge connector slot on the game board. Following figure shows the completed assembly of the Arduboy Game Controller.

If you need to use the CAN Open protocol, first we look at the back side of the PCB board, you can see the Pads below, Note The picture shows another board, but it doesn't matter, the operation method is the same. These pads are connected to the OBD side by default. We have to prepare a knife to disconnect the OBD side, and then use an electric soldering iron to solder the CAN Open side of the pads. Getting Started \u00b6 Here we use the Arduino IDE as a demonstration, through this chapter you can learn how to get started with CANBed. You need a micro USB cable to connect the CANBed FD Dev board to the computer. IDE and Driver \u00b6 There's Arduino leonardo bootloader in the board. Click to get the latest Arduino IDE . There's Arduino Leonardo driver in the folder: Arduino/drivers. Download the install the library \u00b6 Click to get the Arduino Library for CANBed FD Dev board. In the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library to install the Library. Open the code and upload it to the board \u00b6 Open the Arduino IDE, here we open the send example. This example can continuously send data to the CAN Bus. #include <mcp_can.h> #include <SPI.h> const int SPI_CS_PIN = 17 ; // CANBed V1 // const int SPI_CS_PIN = 3; // CANBed M0 // const int SPI_CS_PIN = 9; // CAN Bus Shield MCP_CAN CAN ( SPI_CS_PIN ); // Set CS pin void setup () { Serial . begin ( 115200 ); while ( !

Then you can upload the program to the CANBed FD Dev board by pressing the Upolading button on Arduino IDE. Arduino Code \u00b6 We provide an Arduino library for CANBed . Note Please change the SPI_CS_PIN to 17 for CANBed V1 There're many examples for the library, which is consist of, OBDII-PIDs - Get data from OBD-II interface send - Send a frame to CAN Bus recv - Receive a frame from CAN Bus set_mask_filter_recv - Receive a frame from CAN Bus with mask and filter setting APIs \u00b6 1. Set the Baud rate \u00b6 This function is used to initialize the baud rate of the CAN Bus system. The available baud rates are listed as follows: #define CAN_5KBPS 1 #define CAN_10KBPS 2 #define CAN_20KBPS 3 #define CAN_25KBPS 4 #define CAN_31K25BPS 5 #define CAN_33KBPS 6 #define CAN_40KBPS 7 #define CAN_50KBPS 8 #define CAN_80KBPS 9 #define CAN_83K3BPS 10 #define CAN_95KBPS 11 #define CAN_100KBPS 12 #define CAN_125KBPS 13 #define CAN_200KBPS 14 #define CAN_250KBPS 15 #define CAN_500KBPS 16 #define CAN_666kbps 17 #define CAN_1000KBPS 18 2. Set Receive Mask and Filter \u00b6 There are 2 receive mask registers and 5 filter registers on the controller chip that guarantee you getting data from the target device. They are useful especially in a large network consisting of numerous nodes. We provide two functions for you to utilize these mask and filter registers. They are: Mask: init_Mask(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData); Filter: init_Filt(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData); num represents which register to use. You can fill 0 or 1 for mask and 0 to 5 for filter. ext represents the status of the frame. 0 means it's a mask or filter for a standard frame. 1 means it's for a extended frame. ulData represents the content of the mask of filter. 3. Check Receive \u00b6 The MCP2515 can operate in either a polled mode, where the software checks for a received frame, or using additional pins to signal that a frame has been received or transmit completed. Use the following function to poll for received frames. INT8U MCP_CAN::checkReceive(void); The function will return 1 if a frame arrives, and 0 if nothing arrives. 4. Get CAN ID \u00b6 When some data arrive, you can use the following function to get the CAN ID of the \"send\" node. INT32U MCP_CAN::getCanId(void) 5. Send a frame \u00b6 CAN.sendMsgBuf(INT8U id, INT8U ext, INT8U len, data_buf); It is a function to send data onto the bus. In which: id ID of can frame. ext represents the status of the frame. '0' means standard frame. '1' means extended frame. len represents the length of this frame. data_buf is the content of this message. For example, In the 'send' example, we have: unsigned char stmp[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}; CAN.sendMsgBuf(0x00, 0, 8, stmp); //send out the message 'stmp' to the bus and tell other devices this is a standard frame from 0x00. 6. Receive a frame \u00b6 The following function is used to receive data on the 'receive' node: CAN.readMsgBuf(unsigned char len, unsigned char buf); In conditions that masks and filters have been set. This function can only get frames that meet the requirements of masks and filters. len represents the data length. buf is where you store the data. FAQ \u00b6 I can't upload code to CANBed When the board is connected to the computer via the Micro USB cable, a new COM device will appear on the computer. If the new device does not appear on your computer, you can try a different USB cable or try another computer. If your PC recognize the COM port, please try pressing the reset button, then click on the Upload button in Arduino IDE, when the IDE shows compile done, release the reset button immediately.* The RX/TX led light up and never turn off Check if the baudrate of CAN Bus is setting correct Try turning on/off the switch for the 120\u03a9 terminal resistor Check if CANH and CANL is well connected, H to H and L to L How to find the tech support Please contact support@longan-labs.cc for technical support.

We have to prepare a knife to disconnect the OBD side, and then use an electric soldering iron to solder the CAN Open side of the pads. ARDUINO IDE SETUP \u00b6 First download the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software . Arduino IDE can be installed and run on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X operating systems. Download the installer or zip file (Windows only) and install (if you have the zip file, extract it to your Windows computer\u2019s hard drive) it on your operating system. Once finished, start the Arduino IDE.

Note Please change the SPI_CS_PIN to 3 for CANBed M0 There're many examples for the library, which is consist of, OBDII-PIDs - Get data from OBD-II interface send - Send a frame to CAN Bus recv - Receive a frame from CAN Bus set_mask_filter_recv - Receive a frame from CAN Bus with mask and filter setting APIS \u00b6 1. SET THE BAUD RATE \u00b6 This function is used to initialize the baud rate of the CAN Bus system. The available baud rates are listed as follows: #define CAN_5KBPS 1 #define CAN_10KBPS 2 #define CAN_20KBPS 3 #define CAN_25KBPS 4 #define CAN_31K25BPS 5 #define CAN_33KBPS 6 #define CAN_40KBPS 7 #define CAN_50KBPS 8 #define CAN_80KBPS 9 #define CAN_83K3BPS 10 #define CAN_95KBPS 11 #define CAN_100KBPS 12 #define CAN_125KBPS 13 #define CAN_200KBPS 14 #define CAN_250KBPS 15 #define CAN_500KBPS 16 #define CAN_666kbps 17 #define CAN_1000KBPS 18 2. SET RECEIVE MASK AND FILTER \u00b6 There are 2 receive mask registers and 5 filter registers on the controller chip that guarantee you getting data from the target device. They are useful especially in a large network consisting of numerous nodes. We provide two functions for you to utilize these mask and filter registers. They are: Mask: init_Mask(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData); Filter: init_Filt(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData); num represents which register to use. You can fill 0 or 1 for mask and 0 to 5 for filter. ext represents the status of the frame. 0 means it's a mask or filter for a standard frame. 1 means it's for a extended frame. ulData represents the content of the mask of filter. 3. CHECK RECEIVE \u00b6 The MCP2515 can operate in either a polled mode, where the software checks for a received frame, or using additional pins to signal that a frame has been received or transmit completed. Use the following function to poll for received frames. INT8U MCP_CAN::checkReceive(void); The function will return 1 if a frame arrives, and 0 if nothing arrives. 4. GET CAN ID \u00b6 When some data arrive, you can use the following function to get the CAN ID of the \"send\" node. INT32U MCP_CAN::getCanId(void) 5. SEND A FRAME \u00b6 CAN.sendMsgBuf(INT8U id, INT8U ext, INT8U len, data_buf); It is a function to send data onto the bus. In which: id represents where the data comes from. ext represents the status of the frame. '0' means standard frame. '1' means extended frame. len represents the length of this frame. data_buf is the content of this message. For example, In the 'send' example, we have: unsigned char stmp[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}; CAN.sendMsgBuf(0x00, 0, 8, stmp); //send out the message 'stmp' to the bus and tell other devices this is a standard frame from 0x00. 6. RECEIVE A FRAME \u00b6 The following function is used to receive data on the 'receive' node: CAN.readMsgBuf(unsigned char len, unsigned char buf); In conditions that masks and filters have been set. This function can only get frames that meet the requirements of masks and filters. len represents the data length. buf is where you store the data. FAQ \u00b6 The RX/TX led light up and never turn off Check if the baudrate of CAN Bus is setting correct Try turning on/off the switch for the terminal resistor Cehck if CANH and CANL is connected correct How to find the tech support Please feel free to contact joney.sui@longan-labs.cc if you need more help.

During the use of OBD, an OBD-II cable is usually required to connect to the vehicle. Wiring is easy, but hiding the cable is hard. For this reason we designed this OBD-II RF Dev Kit. This kit contains two parts, which we call the transmitter and receiver. The transmitter is inserted into the OBD-II interface of the vehicle, and the transmitter is integrated with CAN-Bus interface and RF communication, which can transmit the data read by CAN-Bus to the remote end through RF. The receiver is a Serial RF Module, which can send the data from the receiving end to the microcontroller through the serial port. If you want to use OBD-II for some interesting projects, you can try this kit, you will not be disappointed.

Then you can upload the program to the CANBed 2040 Dev board by pressing the Upolading button on Arduino IDE. Arduino Code \u00b6 We provide an Arduino library for CANBed 2040 . Note Please change the SPI_CS_PIN to 9 for CANBed 2040 There're many examples for the library, which is consist of, OBDII-PIDs - Get data from OBD-II interface send - Send a frame to CAN Bus recv - Receive a frame from CAN Bus set_mask_filter_recv - Receive a frame from CAN Bus with mask and filter setting APIs \u00b6 1. Set the Baud rate \u00b6 This function is used to initialize the baud rate of the CAN Bus system. The available baud rates are listed as follows: #define CAN_5KBPS 1 #define CAN_10KBPS 2 #define CAN_20KBPS 3 #define CAN_25KBPS 4 #define CAN_31K25BPS 5 #define CAN_33KBPS 6 #define CAN_40KBPS 7 #define CAN_50KBPS 8 #define CAN_80KBPS 9 #define CAN_83K3BPS 10 #define CAN_95KBPS 11 #define CAN_100KBPS 12 #define CAN_125KBPS 13 #define CAN_200KBPS 14 #define CAN_250KBPS 15 #define CAN_500KBPS 16 #define CAN_666kbps 17 #define CAN_1000KBPS 18 2. Set Receive Mask and Filter \u00b6 There are 2 receive mask registers and 5 filter registers on the controller chip that guarantee you getting data from the target device. They are useful especially in a large network consisting of numerous nodes. We provide two functions for you to utilize these mask and filter registers. They are: Mask: init_Mask(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData); Filter: init_Filt(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData); num represents which register to use. You can fill 0 or 1 for mask and 0 to 5 for filter. ext represents the status of the frame. 0 means it's a mask or filter for a standard frame. 1 means it's for a extended frame. ulData represents the content of the mask of filter. 3. Check Receive \u00b6 The MCP2515 can operate in either a polled mode, where the software checks for a received frame, or using additional pins to signal that a frame has been received or transmit completed. Use the following function to poll for received frames. INT8U MCP_CAN::checkReceive(void); The function will return 1 if a frame arrives, and 0 if nothing arrives. 4. Get CAN ID \u00b6 When some data arrive, you can use the following function to get the CAN ID of the \"send\" node. INT32U MCP_CAN::getCanId(void) 5. Send a frame \u00b6 CAN.sendMsgBuf(INT8U id, INT8U ext, INT8U len, data_buf); It is a function to send data onto the bus. In which: id ID of can frame. ext represents the status of the frame. '0' means standard frame. '1' means extended frame. len represents the length of this frame. data_buf is the content of this message. For example, In the 'send' example, we have: unsigned char stmp[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}; CAN.sendMsgBuf(0x00, 0, 8, stmp); //send out the message 'stmp' to the bus and tell other devices this is a standard frame from 0x00. 6. Receive a frame \u00b6 The following function is used to receive data on the 'receive' node: CAN.readMsgBuf(unsigned char len, unsigned char buf); In conditions that masks and filters have been set. This function can only get frames that meet the requirements of masks and filters. len represents the data length. buf is where you store the data. Getting Started with MicroPython \u00b6 What is MicroPython \u00b6 MicroPython is a Python interpreter (with partial native code compilation feature). It provides a subset of Python 3.5 features, implemented for embedded processors and constrained systems. Read more about the differences to CPython here . How to Use \u00b6 As the CANBed 2040 uses the same chip as the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040), please to to Getting Started with Pico for details. FAQ \u00b6 I can't upload code to CANBed 2040 When the board is connected to the computer via the Micro USB cable, a new COM device will appear on the computer. If the new device does not appear on your computer, you can try a different USB cable or try another computer. The RX/TX led light up and never turn off Check if the baudrate of CAN Bus is setting correct Try turning on/off the switch for the 120\u03a9 terminal resistor Check if CANH and CANL is well connected, H to H and L to L How to find the tech support Please contact support@longan-labs.cc for technical support.

Specifications \u00b6 Microcontroller: Atmega32u4 Operating Voltage: 5V Flash Memory: 32KB of which 4KB used by bootloader SRAM: 2.5KB EEPROM: 1KB Clock Speed: 16MHz Remote Distance: >5m Remote Support: 95% of IR Remote on the market Download the Code \u00b6 About Arduino Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. You can download the code at Github , it\u2019s an Arduino Library. After download the code, extract it to the libraries folder of your Adruino. If there\u2019s \u201c-master\u201d in the folder name, just remove it, otherwise it may cause some compile error. Read Key Value of a Remote \u00b6 IRduino can support almost all the IR remote on the market, include RV remote, Air conditioning remote and even your DVD remote. Open Get_IR_Code example on the examples folder of IRduino library. Tool -> booards to select Arduino Leonardo, then the right COM. Finally, upload the code to your IRduino. Open Serial Monitor, press a remote key, then you can get something on the monitor: We can find that Serial Monitor had printed a Char type data, which is from 0x00 to 0xff. I had press two button, so there\u2019s 2 key value on the above image, which is 0x0A and 0x40. Then in this way we can the values of the four button: KEY NUM UP 0xEE DOWN 0xAE LEFT 0xCE RIGHT 0x8E OK 0x5E: Remember this value, which is important in the next step. Write The Code \u00b6 Don\u2019t worry about the code, it\u2019s easy just like you use an Arduino. Actually I had finish this example, now we learn about it. Open Task_Mode_Arrow example. Now here we goto the code. We notice the remote key value is used here: // IR CODE DEFINE #define IR_CODE_UP 0xEE #define IR_CODE_DOWN 0xAE #define IR_CODE_LEFT 0xCE #define IR_CODE_RIGHT 0x8E #define IR_CODE_SPACE 0x5E Then the setup: // add task item IRduino . addItem ( IR_CODE_UP , task_up ); IRduino . addItem ( IR_CODE_DOWN , task_down ); IRduino . addItem ( IR_CODE_LEFT , task_left ); IRduino . addItem ( IR_CODE_RIGHT , task_right ); Here we add 5 tasks via the IRduino.addItem function. This function need two parameter, remote key value and a function pointer. Don\u2019t know funciton pointer? Just forget it, actually it\u2019s just the function name. As we had add four task, so we need 4 function, as following: // add task void task_up () { iRduino . keyPressRelease ( KEY_UP_ARROW ); } void task_down () { iRduino . keyPressRelease ( KEY_DOWN_ARROW ); } void task_left () { iRduino . keyPressRelease ( KEY_LEFT_ARROW ); } void task_right () { iRduino . keyPressRelease ( KEY_RIGHT_ARROW ); } void task_space () { iRduino . keyPressRelease ( KEY_SPACE ); } I guess you have had ideas about these four function. Yes, they just press and release some key on your PC. Then let\u2019s have a summary, to add a task, we need 3 steps: Write down the remote key value Write a task function, which will have some certain use, like press some key on PC Use addItem funciton to add the task, then your press the key on remote, IRduino will run the task function once.

However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where some small adjustments are necessary to preserve the desired style. Adding assets \u00b6 MkDocs provides several ways to interfere with themes. In order to make a few tweaks to an existing theme, you can just add your stylesheets and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional stylesheets \u00b6 If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate stylesheet. The easiest way is by creating a new stylesheet file in your docs directory: mkdir docs/stylesheets touch docs/stylesheets/extra.css Then, add the following line to your mkdocs.yml : extra_css : - 'stylesheets/extra.css' Spin up the development server with mkdocs serve and start typing your changes in your additional stylesheet file \u2013 you can see them instantly after saving, as the MkDocs development server implements live reloading. Additional JavaScript \u00b6 The same is true for additional JavaScript. If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in your docs directory: mkdir docs/javascripts touch docs/javascripts/extra.js Then, add the following line to your mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - 'javascripts/extra.js' Further assistance can be found in the MkDocs documentation . Extending the theme \u00b6 If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some part), you can extend the theme. From version 0.16 on MkDocs implements theme extension , an easy way to override parts of a theme without forking and changing the main theme. Setup and theme structure \u00b6 Reference the Material theme as usual in your mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides, e.g. theme , which you reference using theme_dir : theme : 'material' theme_dir : 'theme' Theme extension prerequisites As the theme_dir variable is used for the theme extension process, the Material theme needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the theme parameter in your mkdocs.yml . The structure in the theme directory must mirror the directory structure of the original theme, as any file in the theme directory will replace the file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further assets may also be put in the theme directory. The directory layout of the Material theme is as follows: . \u251c\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 images/ # Images and icons \u2502 \u251c\u2500 javascripts/ # JavaScript \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ # Stylesheets \u251c\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 disqus.html # Disqus integration \u2502 \u251c\u2500 footer.html # Footer bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 header.html # Header bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language.html # Localized labels \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav-item.html # Main navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav.html # Main navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 search.html # Search box \u2502 \u251c\u2500 social.html # Social links \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source.html # Repository information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs-item.html # Tabs navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs.html # Tabs navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 toc-item.html # Table of contents item \u2502 \u2514\u2500 toc.html # Table of contents \u251c\u2500 404 .html # 404 error page \u251c\u2500 base.html # Base template \u2514\u2500 main.html # Default page Overriding partials \u00b6 In order to override the footer, we can replace the footer.html partial with our own partial. To do this, create the file partials/footer.html in the theme directory. MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding template blocks \u00b6 Besides overriding partials, one can also override so called template blocks, which are defined inside the Material theme and wrap specific features. To override a template block, create a main.html inside the theme directory and define the block, e.g.: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} <title>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</title> {% endblock %} The Material theme provides the following template blocks: Block name Wrapped contents analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration content Wraps the main content disqus Wraps the disqus integration extrahead Empty block to define additional meta tags fonts Wraps the webfont definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar htmltitle Wraps the <title> tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries, e.g. Modernizr repo Wraps the repository link in the header bar scripts Wraps the JavaScript application logic source Wraps the linked source files search_box Wraps the search form in the header bar site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_name Wraps the site name in the header bar site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents social Wraps the social links in the footer styles Wraps the stylesheets (also extra sources) For more on this topic refer to the MkDocs documentation Theme development \u00b6 The Material theme is built on modern technologies like ES6, Webpack , Babel and SASS . If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the Material theme and recompile it. This is fairly easy. Environment setup \u00b6 In order to start development on the Material theme, a Node.js version of at least 5 is required, as well as the package manager yarn which is a better version of npm . First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkdocs-material pip install -r requirements.txt yarn install Development mode \u00b6 The Material theme uses a sophisticated asset pipeline using Gulp and Webpack which can be started with the following command: yarn start This will also start the MkDocs development server which will monitor changes on assets, templates and documentation. Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this documentation in front of you. For example, changing the color palette is as simple as changing the $md-color-primary and $md-color-accent variables in src/assets/stylesheets/_config.scss : $ md-color-primary : $ clr-red-400 ; $ md-color-accent : $ clr-teal-a700 ; Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overriden when the theme is built. Build process \u00b6 When you've finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: yarn run build This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all stylesheets and JavaScript sources. When the command exits, the final theme is located in the material directory. Add the theme_dir variable pointing to the aforementioned directory in your original mkdocs.yml .

Installing MkDocs \u00b6 Before installing MkDocs , you need to make sure you have Python and pip \u2013 the Python package manager \u2013 up and running. You can verify if you're already good to go with the following commands: python --version # Python 2.7.13 pip --version # pip 9.0.1 Installing and verifying MkDocs is as simple as: pip install mkdocs && mkdocs --version # mkdocs, version 0.16.0 MkDocs version requirements Material requires MkDocs >= 0.16. Installing Material \u00b6 using pip \u00b6 Material can be installed with pip : pip install mkdocs-material using choco \u00b6 If you're on Windows you can use Chocolatey to install Material : choco install mkdocs-material This will install all required dependencies like Python and MkDocs . cloning from GitHub \u00b6 Material can also be used without a system-wide installation by cloning the repository into a subfolder of your project's root directory: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git This is especially useful if you want to extend the theme and override some parts of the theme. The theme will reside in the folder mkdocs-material/material . Troubleshooting \u00b6 Installation on macOS When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, pip tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions. There are two possible solutions for this: Installing in user space (recommended): Provide the --user flag to the install command and pip will install the package in a user-site location. This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you may be having with pip . Error: unrecognized theme 'material' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and the Material theme through pip , so both packages end up in different locations. MkDocs only checks it's install location for themes. Usage \u00b6 In order to enable the theme just add one of the following lines to your project's mkdocs.yml . If you installed Material using pip: theme : 'material' If you cloned Material from GitHub: theme_dir : 'mkdocs-material/material' MkDocs includes a development server, so you can review your changes as you go. The development server can be started with the following command: mkdocs serve Now you can point your browser to http://localhost:8000 and the Material theme should be visible. From here on, you can start writing your documentation, or read on and customize the theme through some options. Options \u00b6 The Material theme adds some extra variables for configuration via your project's mkdocs.yml . See the following sections for all available options. Changing the color palette \u00b6 A default is hue is defined for every primary and accent color on Google's Material Design color palette , which makes it very easy to change the overall look of the theme. Just set the primary and accent colors using the following variables: extra : palette : primary : 'indigo' accent : 'light blue' Color names are case-insensitive, but must match the names of the Material Design color palette. Valid values are: red , pink , purple , deep purple , indigo , blue , light blue , cyan , teal , green , light green , lime , yellow , amber , orange , deep orange , brown , grey and blue grey . The last three colors can only be used as a primary color. If the color is set via this configuration, an additional CSS file that defines the color palette is automatically included. If you want to keep things lean, clone the repository and recompile the theme with your custom colors set. See the guide on customization for more information. Primary colors \u00b6 Click on a tile to change the primary color of the theme: Red Pink Purple Deep Purple Indigo Blue Light Blue Cyan Teal Green Light Green Lime Yellow Amber Orange Deep Orange Brown Grey Blue Grey var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-primary]\"); Array.prototype.forEach.call(buttons, function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.dataset.mdColorPrimary = this.dataset.mdColorPrimary; }) }) Accent colors \u00b6 Click on a tile to change the accent color of the theme: Red Pink Purple Deep Purple Indigo Blue Light Blue Cyan Teal Green Light Green Lime Yellow Amber Orange Deep Orange var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-accent]\"); Array.prototype.forEach.call(buttons, function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.dataset.mdColorAccent = this.dataset.mdColorAccent; }) }) Changing the font family \u00b6 By default the Roboto font family is included with the theme, specifically the regular sans-serif type for text and the monospaced type for code. Both fonts are loaded from Google Fonts and can be changed to other fonts, like for example the Ubuntu font family : extra : font : text : 'Ubuntu' code : 'Ubuntu Mono' The text font will be loaded in weights 400 and 700 , the monospaced font in regular weight. If you want to load fonts from other destinations or don't want to use the Google Fonts loading magic, just set font to false : extra : font : false Adding a source repository \u00b6 To include a link to the repository of your project within your documentation, set the following variables via your project's mkdocs.yml : repo_name : 'my-github-handle/my-project' repo_url : 'https://github.com/my-github-handle/my-project' The name of the repository will be rendered next to the search bar on big screens and as part of the main navigation drawer on smaller screen sizes. Furthermore, if repo_url points to a GitHub, BitBucket or GitLab repository, the respective service logo will be shown next to the name of the repository. Additionally, for GitHub, the number of stars and forks is shown. Why is there an edit button at the top of every article? If the repo_url is set to a GitHub or BitBucket repository, and the repo_name is set to GitHub or BitBucket (implied by default), an edit button will appear at the top of every article. This is the automatic behavior that MkDocs implements. See the MkDocs documentation on more guidance regarding the edit_uri attribute, which defines whether the edit button is shown or not. Adding a favicon \u00b6 A favicon can be added by setting the site_favicon variable to an .ico or image file: site_favicon : 'images/favicon.ico' Adding a logo \u00b6 Your logo should have rectangular shape with a minimum resolution of 128x128, leave some room towards the edges and be composed of high contrast areas on a transparent ground, as it will be placed on the colored header bar and drawer. Simply create the folder docs/images , add your logo and embed it with: extra : logo : 'images/logo.svg' Adding social links \u00b6 Social accounts can be linked in the footer of the documentation using the automatically included FontAwesome webfont. The type must denote the name of the social service, e.g. github , twitter or linkedin and the link must contain the URL you want to link to: extra : social : - type : 'github' link : 'https://github.com/squidfunk' - type : 'twitter' link : 'https://twitter.com/squidfunk' - type : 'linkedin' link : 'https://de.linkedin.com/in/martin-donath-20a95039' The links are generated in order and the type of the links must match the name of the FontAwesome glyph. The fa is automatically added, so github will result in fa fa-github . Google Analytics integration \u00b6 MkDocs makes it easy to integrate site tracking with Google Analytics. Besides basic tracking, clicks on all outgoing links can be tracked as well as how site search is used. Tracking can be activated in your project's mkdocs.yml : google_analytics : - 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X' - 'auto' Disqus integation \u00b6 Material for MkDocs is integrated with Disqus , so if you want to add a comments section to your documentation set the shortname of your Disqus project in your mkdocs.yml : extra : disqus : 'your-disqus-shortname' A new entry at the bottom of the table of contents is generated that is linking to the comments section. The necessary JavaScript is automatically included. Requirements site_url value must be set in mkdocs.yml for the Discus integration to load properly. Localization \u00b6 Translations \u00b6 Material for MkDocs supports internationalization (i18n). In order to translate the labels (e.g. Previous and Next in the footer), you can override the file partials/language.html and provide your own translations inside the macro t : {% macro t ( key ) %}{{ { \"language\" : \"en\" , \"edit.link.title\" : \"Edit this page\" , \"footer.previous\" : \"Previous\" , \"footer.next\" : \"Next\" , \"meta.comments\" : \"Comments\" , \"meta.source\" : \"Source\" , \"search.languages\" : \"\" , \"search.placeholder\" : \"Search\" , \"search.result.placeholder\" : \"Type to start searching\" , \"search.result.none\" : \"No matching documents\" , \"search.result.one\" : \"1 matching document\" , \"search.result.other\" : \"# matching documents\" , \"source.link.title\" : \"Go to repository\" , \"toc.title\" : \"Table of contents\" }[ key ] }}{% endmacro %} Just copy the file from the original theme and make your adjustments. See the section on overriding partials and the general guide on theme extension in the customization guide. Furthermore, see the example configuration for a head start. Site search \u00b6 Site search is implemented using lunr.js , which includes stemmers for the English language by default, while stemmers for other languages are included with lunr-languages , both of which are integrated with this theme. Support for other languages and even multilingual search can be activated by setting the key search.languages to a comma-separated list of supported 2-letter language codes, e.g.: {% macro t ( key ) %}{{ { ... \"search.languages\" : \"en, de, ru\" , ... }[ key ] }}{% endmacro %} This will automatically load the stemmers for the specified languages and set them up with site search, nothing else to be done. At the time of writing, the following languages are supported: English en , French fr , Spanish es , Italian it , Japanese jp , Dutch du , Danish da , Portguese pt , Finnish fi , Romanian ro , Hungarian hu , Russian ru , Norwegian no , Swedish sv and Turkish tr . Only specify the languages you really need Be aware that including suppport for other languages increases the general JavaScript payload by around 20kb (without gzip) and by another 15-30kb per language. Tabs \u00b6 From version 1.1.0 on, Material supports another layer on top of the main navigation for larger screens in the form of tabs. This is especially useful for larger documentation projects with only few top-level sections. Tabs can be enabled by setting the respective feature flag to true: extra : feature : tabs : true More advanced customization \u00b6 If you want to change the general appearance of the Material theme, see this article for more information on advanced customization. Extensions \u00b6 MkDocs supports several Markdown extensions . The following extensions are not enabled by default (see the link for which are enabled by default) but highly recommended, so they should be switched on at all times: markdown_extensions : - admonition - codehilite(guess_lang=false) - toc(permalink=true) For more information, see the following list of extensions supported by the Material theme including more information regarding installation and usage: Admonition Codehilite Footnotes Metadata Permalinks PyMdown Extensions Full example \u00b6 Below is a full example configuration for a mkdocs.yml : # Project information site_name : 'My Project' site_description : 'A short description of my project' site_author : 'John Doe' site_url : 'https://john-doe.github.io/my-project' # Repository repo_name : 'my-github-handle/my-project' repo_url : 'https://github.com/john-doe/my-project' # Copyright copyright : 'Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2017 John Doe' # Documentation and theme theme : 'material' # Options extra : logo : 'images/logo.svg' palette : primary : 'indigo' accent : 'indigo' font : text : 'Roboto' code : 'Roboto Mono' social : - type : 'github' link : 'https://github.com/john-doe' - type : 'twitter' link : 'https://twitter.com/john-doe' - type : 'linkedin' link : 'https://de.linkedin.com/in/john-doe' # Google Analytics google_analytics : - 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X' - 'auto' # Extensions markdown_extensions : - admonition - codehilite(guess_lang=false) - toc(permalink=true)","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting-started/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting-started/#installation","text":"Set up Material using Docker The official Docker image for Material comes with all dependencies pre-installed and ready-to-use with the latest version published on PyPI, packaged in a very small image (23MB compressed).","title":"Installation"},{"location":"getting-started/#installing-mkdocs","text":"Before installing MkDocs , you need to make sure you have Python and pip \u2013 the Python package manager \u2013 up and running.

There are two possible solutions for this: Installing in user space (recommended): Provide the --user flag to the install command and pip will install the package in a user-site location. This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you may be having with pip . Error: unrecognized theme 'material' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and the Material theme through pip , so both packages end up in different locations.

Installation \u00b6 Add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - admonition Usage \u00b6 Admonition blocks follow a simple syntax: every block is started with !!! , followed by a single keyword which is used as the type qualifier of the block. The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces. Example: !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title \u00b6 By default, the block title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can easily be changed by adding a quoted string after the type qualifier. Example: !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.

Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Removing the title \u00b6 Similar to setting a custom title , the icon and title can be omitted by providing an empty string after the type qualifier: Example: !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The highlighting process is executed during compilation of the Markdown file. Syntax highlighting not working? Please ensure that Pygments is installed. See the next section for further directions on how to set up Pygments or use the official Docker image with all dependencies pre-installed. Installation \u00b6 CodeHilite parses code blocks and wraps them in pre tags. If Pygments is installed, which is a generic syntax highlighter with support for over 300 languages , CodeHilite will also highlight the code block. Pygments can be installed with the following command: pip install pygments To enable CodeHilite, add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - codehilite Migrating from Material 0.2.x In 0.2.x the CodeHilite extension was included with codehilite(css_class=code) which switched the CSS class from .codehilite to .code . The current version of the theme doesn't require that and defines styles for the default .codehilite class, so the part css_class=code needs to be removed. Usage \u00b6 Specifying the language \u00b6 The CodeHilite extension uses the same syntax as regular Markdown code blocks, but needs to know the language of the code block. This can be done in three different ways. via Markdown syntax recommended \u00b6 In Markdown, code blocks can be opened and closed by writing three backticks on separate lines. To add code highlighting to those blocks, the easiest way is to specify the language directly after the opening block. Example: ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` Result: import tensorflow as tf via Shebang \u00b6 Alternatively, if the first line of a code block contains a shebang, the language is derived from the path referenced in the shebang. This will only work for code blocks that are indented using four spaces, not for those encapsulated in three backticks. Example: #!/usr/bin/python import tensorflow as tf Result: #!/usr/bin/python import tensorflow as tf via three colons \u00b6 If the first line starts with three colons followed by a language identifier, the first line is stripped. This will only work for code blocks that are indented using four spaces, not for those encapsulated in three backticks. Example: :::python import tensorflow as tf Result: import tensorflow as tf Adding line numbers \u00b6 Line numbers can be added by enabling the linenums flag in your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - codehilite(linenums=true) Example: ``` python \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result: 1 2 3 4 5 6 \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting specific lines \u00b6 Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language identifier. Line counts start at 1. Example: ``` python hl_lines=\"3 4\" \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result: 1 2 3 4 5 6 \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Supported languages excerpt \u00b6 CodeHilite uses Pygments , a generic syntax highlighter with support for over 300 languages , so the following list of examples is just an excerpt.

Inserting the reference \u00b6 The footnote reference is enclosed in square brackets and starts with a caret, followed by an arbitrary label which may contain numeric identifiers [1, 2, 3, ...] or names [Granovetter et al. 1998]. The rendered references are always consecutive superscripted numbers. Example: Lorem ipsum[^1] dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.[^2] Result: Lorem ipsum 1 dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 2 Inserting the content \u00b6 The footnote content is also declared with a label, which must match the label used for the footnote reference. It can be inserted at an arbitrary position in the document and is always rendered at the bottom of the page. Furthermore, a backlink is automatically added to the footnote reference. on a single line \u00b6 Short statements can be written on the same line. Example: [ ^1 ]: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Jump to footnote at the bottom of the page on multiple lines \u00b6 Paragraphs should be written on the next line. As with all Markdown blocks, the content must be indented by four spaces. Example: [ ^2 ]: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Jump to footnote at the bottom of the page Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. \u21a9 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla.

Installation \u00b6 Add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - meta Usage \u00b6 Metadata is written as a series of key-value pairs at the beginning of the Markdown document, delimited by a blank line which ends the metadata context. Naturally, the metadata is stripped from the document before rendering the actual page content and made available to the theme. Example: title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet description: Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor. path: path/to/file source: file.js # Headline ... See the next section which covers the metadata that is supported by Material. Overriding the title \u00b6 The page title can be overridden on a per-document level: title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet This will set the title tag inside the document head for the current page to the provided value. It will also override the default behavior of Material for MkDocs which appends the site title using a dash as a separator to the page title. Overriding the description \u00b6 The page description can also be overridden on a per-document level: description : Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor. This will set the meta tag containing the site description inside the document head for the current page to the provided value. Linking sources \u00b6 When a document is related to a specific set of source files and the repo_url is defined inside the project's mkdocs.yml , the files can be linked using the source key: source: file.js A new entry at the bottom of the table of contents is generated that is linking to the section listing the linked source files.

For this reason, the installation of this package is highly recommended as it's well-integrated with the Material theme. Installation \u00b6 The PyMdown Extensions package can be installed with the following command: pip install pymdown-extensions The following list of extensions that are part of the PyMdown Extensions package are recommended to be used together with the Material theme: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.arithmatex - pymdownx.betterem(smart_enable=all) - pymdownx.caret - pymdownx.critic - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_generator : !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg - pymdownx.inlinehilite - pymdownx.magiclink - pymdownx.mark - pymdownx.smartsymbols - pymdownx.superfences - pymdownx.tasklist(custom_checkbox=true) - pymdownx.tilde Usage \u00b6 GitHub Flavored Markdown \u00b6 Most of the extensions included in the PyMdown Extensions package try to bring the Markdown experience closer to GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). The PyMdown Extensions package adds a shorthand to enable all of the included extensions that provide the GFM experience. However, usage of the shorthand is discouraged, because some extensions are not supported, as the Material theme uses some incompatible extensions included in the standard Markdown library. BetterEm \u00b6 BetterEm improves the handling of emphasis markup ( bold and italic ) within Markdown by providing a more sophisticated parser for better detecting start and end tokens. Read the documentation for usage notes . Emoji \u00b6 Emoji adds the ability to insert a -load of emojis that we use in our daily lives. See the EmojiOne demo for a list of all available emojis. Happy scrolling Legal disclaimer Material has no affiliation with EmojiOne which is released under CC BY 4.0 . When including EmojiOne images or CSS, please read the EmojiOne license to ensure proper usage and attribution. MagicLink \u00b6 MagicLink detects links in Markdown and auto-generates the necessary markup, so no special syntax is required. It auto-links http[s]:// and ftp:// links, as well as references to email addresses: SuperFences \u00b6 SuperFences provides the ability to nest code blocks under blockquotes, lists and other block elements, which the Fenced Code Blocks extension from the standard Markdown library doesn't parse correctly. Tasklist \u00b6 Tasklist adds support for styled checkbox lists. This is useful for keeping track of tasks and showing what has been done and has yet to be done. Checkbox lists are like regular lists, but prefixed with [ ] for empty or [x] for filled checkboxes. Example: * [x] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit * [x] Nulla lobortis egestas semper * [x] Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est * [ ] Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt * [x] In hac habitasse platea dictumst * [x] In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus * [x] Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis * [ ] Praesent sed risus massa * [ ] Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque * [ ] Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit Nulla lobortis egestas semper Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt In hac habitasse platea dictumst In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis Praesent sed risus massa Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Tilde \u00b6 Tilde provides an easy way to strike through cross out text.

The portion of text that should be highlighted must be enclosed in two equal signs ==...== . SmartSymbols \u00b6 SmartSymbols converts markup for special characters into their corresponding symbols, e.g. arrows (\u2190, \u2192, \u2194), trademark and copyright symbols (\u00a9, \u2122, \u00ae) and fractions (\u00bd, \u00bc, ...). Critic \u00b6 Critic implements Critic Markup , a Markdown extension that enables the tracking of changes (additions, deletions and comments) on documents. During compilation of the Markdown document, changes can be rendered (default), accepted or rejected. Text can be deleted and replacement text added . This can also be combined into one a single operation. Highlighting is also possible and comments can be added inline . Formatting can also be applied to blocks, by putting the opening and closing tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content. Arithmatex MathJax \u00b6 Arithmatex integrates Material with MathJax which parses block-style and inline equations written in TeX markup and outputs them in mathematical notation. See this thread for a short introduction and quick reference on how to write equations in TeX syntax. Besides activating the extension in the mkdocs.yml , the MathJax JavaScript runtime needs to be included. This must be done with additional JavaScript : extra_javascript : - 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML' If you want to override the default MathJax configuration, you can do this by adding another JavaScript file before the MathJax runtime in extra_javascript which contains your MathJax configuration, e.g.: window . MathJax = { tex2jax : { inlineMath : [ [ \"\\\\(\" , \"\\\\)\" ] ], displayMath : [ [ \"\\\\[\" , \"\\\\]\" ] ] }, TeX : { TagSide : \"right\" , TagIndent : \".8em\" , MultLineWidth : \"85%\" , equationNumbers : { autoNumber : \"AMS\" , }, unicode : { fonts : \"STIXGeneral,'Arial Unicode MS'\" } }, displayAlign : \"left\" , showProcessingMessages : false , messageStyle : \"none\" }; In your mkdocs.yml , include it with: extra_javascript : - 'javascripts/extra.js' - 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML' Blocks \u00b6 Blocks are enclosed in $$ ... $$ which are placed on separate lines.
